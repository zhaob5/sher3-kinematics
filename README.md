## SHER-3.0 Kinematics and Jacobian Analysis

This repository contains detailed derivations and explanations of the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, Jacobian, and pseudo-inverse Jacobian analysis for the SHER-3.0 surgical robot. It includes analytical computation results in Python, validation through SolidWorks motion simulation, and detailed documentation for future insights and reference.
